# Diffie-Hellman-Key-Swift-Playground
WWDC 2023 Swift Student Challenge Submission(Accepted)

This README file will provide an overview of my project, the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Crash Course app, and guide users on how to use and contribute to it effectively.

# Overview
The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Crash Course is a Swift-based iOS app built with SwiftUI. Its primary goal is to educate users about the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange algorithm, a fundamental concept in modern cryptography. The app offers a comprehensive crash course that covers the basics of the algorithm, allows users to input their values for encryption calculations, and concludes with a quiz to test their knowledge.

# Features
The app incorporates the following key features:

1) Crash Course: The crash course section provides a detailed explanation of the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange algorithm, including its history, underlying principles, and step-by-step implementation.

2) Interactive Input: Users can input their own values to calculate the various components required for encryption using the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange algorithm. This interactive feature helps users understand how the algorithm works in practice.
